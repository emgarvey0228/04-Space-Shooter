*I have NO IDEA why my spaceship won't appear!!!!!!! I have literally watched your screencast 30 times and I'm only confusing myself even more*
Building my first 2D game in Godot for my Game Technology class at Indiana University. This game is a Space Shooter interactive game where you have the chance to control a spaceship by using the WASD key controls. In this mini interactive game, your health weakens as you collide with the enemies. Press the space bar when your ready to fire your bullets!
